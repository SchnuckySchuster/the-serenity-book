= Extending Serenity WebDriver Integration

Serenity offers a simple way to extend the default WebDriver capabilities and customise the driver creation and teardown activities. Simply implement the `BeforeAWebdriverScenario` and/or the `AfterAWebDriverScenario` interfaces (both are in the `net.serenitybdd.core.webdriver.enhancers` package). Serenity will execute `BeforeAWebdriverScenario` classes just before a driver instance is created, allowing you to add customised options to the driver capabilities. Any `AfterAWebDriverScenario` are executed at the end of a test, just before the driver is closed.

== The BeforeAWebdriverScenario interface

The `BeforeAWebdriverScenario` is used to enhance the `DesiredCapabilities` object that will be passed to the WebDriver instance when a new driver is created. The method call passes in the requested driver and the `TestOutcome` object, which contains information about the name and tags used for this test. It also passes in the `EnvironmentVariables`, which gives you access to the current environment configuration. An example of a simple `BeforeAWebdriverScenario` is shown below:

[source,java]
----
public class MyCapabilityEnhancer implements BeforeAWebdriverScenario {

    @Override
    public DesiredCapabilities apply(EnvironmentVariables environmentVariables,
                                     SupportedWebDriver driver,
                                     TestOutcome testOutcome,
                                     DesiredCapabilities capabilities) {
        capabilities.setCapability("name", testOutcome.getStoryTitle() + " - " + testOutcome.getTitle());
        return capabilities;
    }
}
----

== The AfterAWebdriverScenario interface

The `AfterAWebdriverScenario` is called at the end of a test, just before the driver is closed, and once the result of the test is known. The test result (and other details) can be obtained from the `TestOutcome` parameter. This allows any last manipulations or checks to be performed on the driver, before the end of the test. The following example checks the result of the test that has just finished, and adds a cookie with a value depending on the test outcome:

[source,java]
----
public class MyTestResultUpdater implements AfterAWebdriverScenario {
    void apply(EnvironmentVariables environmentVariables,
               TestOutcome testOutcome,
               WebDriver driver) {
       if ((driver == null) || (!RemoteDriver.isARemoteDriver(driver))) {
           return;
       }

       Cookie cookie = new Cookie("testPassed",
                                   testOutcome.isFailure() || testOutcome.isError() || testOutcome.isCompromised() ? "false" : "true");
       driver.manage().addCookie(cookie);
    }
}
----

== Configuring the extension packages

The last thing you need to do is to tell Serenity what package it needs to look for your extension classes. Add the package, or a parent package to your Serenity configuration using the `serenity.extension.packages`.

`serenity.extension.packages=com.acme.myserenityextensions`

You can find an example of how these classes are implemented in a real-world use case in the https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-core/tree/master/serenity-browserstack/src/main/java/net/serenitybdd/browserstack[serenity-browserstack] module on Github.


== Custom WebDriver implementations

You can add your own custom WebDriver provider by implementing the DriverSource interface. First, you need to set up the following system properties (e.g. in your `serenity.properties` file):

-----
webdriver.driver = provided
webdriver.provided.type = mydriver
webdriver.provided.mydriver = com.acme.MyPhantomJSDriver
thucydides.driver.capabilities = mydriver
-----

Your custom driver must implement the DriverSource interface, as shown here:

[source,java]
-----
public class MyPhantomJSDriver implements DriverSource {

    @Override
    public WebDriver newDriver() {
        try {
            DesiredCapabilities capabilities = DesiredCapabilities.phantomjs();
            // Add
            return new PhantomJSDriver(ResolvingPhantomJSDriverService.createDefaultService(), capabilities);
        }
        catch (IOException e) {
            throw new Error(e);
        }
    }

	@Override
    public boolean takesScreenshots() {
        return true;
    }
}
-----

This driver will now take screenshots normally.
