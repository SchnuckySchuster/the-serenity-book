= First Steps with Serenity BDD

In this section, we will help you get going with your first Serenity BDD project. We will be using the simplest of all Serenity BDD setups - Serenity with pure JUnit. Later on, you will learn how to use Serenity with BDD tools like Cucumber and JBehave, and also the powerful Screenplay plugin. But let's start with something simple.

== What you need to start

=== Java 8
Test Automation is a development activity, so you will need some familiarity with Java. Serenity BDD uses Java 8, so make sure you have a http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[JDK 1.8 or later] installed.

=== An Integrated Development Environment

You will need a modern IDE to work with Java. We recommend IntelliJ (you can download the Community Edition, which is free, https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download[from here]. But Eclipse will work fine as well.

=== A Build Tool

You will also need a build tool, either Gradle or Maven, to run your tests and generate your reports. Make sure you have either http://www.gradle.org/downloads[Gradle 3.x or higher] or https://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven 3.3.x or higher] installed.

== Getting Started

The quickest way to create a new project is to take one of the starter projects on Github. You can find the starter project for JUnit at https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-junit-starter[https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-junit-starter].

You can clone this repository:

----
git clone https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-junit-starter.git
cd serenity-junit-starter
----

Or simply https://github.com/serenity-bdd/serenity-junit-starter/archive/master.zip[download a zip file from here].

If you are using Maven, you can also create a new project using one of the Serenity https://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-archetypes.html[Maven Archetypes].

== So far so good?

The starter project comes with a demo test that you can run. From the command line, run either

----
$ mvn clean verify
----

or

----
$ gradle clean test
----

This should produce something like the following:

----
gradle clean test
Starting a Gradle Daemon (subsequent builds will be faster)

== The project structure

Now import the project into your IDE (be sure to import the project as a Maven or Gradle project). The project structure looks something like this (some less interesting files and directories have been left out):

----
├── pom.xml                                 // <1>
├── build.gradle                            // <2>

<2> Gradle build script
<3> Test code

<5> A sample test case
<6> Step library package
<7> A sample step library

== Your first test

You may have noticed that the test we just ran was marked as "PENDING". This means that this test is still work-in-progress, and hasn't been completed yet. That's why the reports appear as light blue (Serenity's colour for pending tests), and not green.

So let's start out by making this test pass.

=== A simple Serenity test class
Open up the `ASimpleTest.java` class and take a look. You should see something like this:

[source,java]
----

@RunWith(SerenityRunner.class)          <1>
public class ASimpleTest {

    @Steps                              <2>
    MathWizSteps michael;

    @Test
    @Pending                            <3>
    public void addingSums() {
        // Given
        michael.startsWith(1);

        // When
        michael.adds(2);

        // Then
        michael.shouldHave(3);
    }
}
----
<1> The SerenityRunner class tells JUnit that this is a Serenity test
<2> A Serenity step library
<3> This test is work-in-progress, so it won't be executed yet

Serenity tests try to describe a user's journey through the application, and the outcome that we expect at the end of this journey. But we rarely interact directly with the application within the test. Interacting with an application directly within a test (for example, by making WebDriver calls or REST API calls) is a big testing anti-pattern as it leads to code duplication and code that is hard to maintain. It also makes it harder to understand what the feature or requirement the test is checking.

So instead, our tests model the user journey at a higher level. We describe the system user and the actions he or she takes. So in this case, we describe how our system user, Michael, performs a complex calculation:

   - He starts with a value of 1
   - He adds 2
   - We expect him to find a result of 3

At this level, we are not concerned with where he gets the calculator, what web page he navigates to or what REST-API calls he makes. We are only interested in his high-level actions. This helps make our tests more readable and easier to maintain.

[TIP]
====
Later on, you will learn how to model user journeys in an even more flexible manner using the Screenplay pattern.
====

To achieve this layering, we use _step libraries_.

=== A Serenity step library

The `MathWizSteps` class is what we call a _step library_. Step Libraries in Serenity are where we model the behaviour of our users. Tests model how a user interacts with our system, and the step libraries typically model how a particular user does a particular job. In this case, our user (Michael) is a maths wiz doing some complex calculations.

Notice how the step library field (`michael`) is annotated with the `@Steps` annotation. This tells Serenity to inject the step library into the test. We never create instances of the step libraries ourselves, as Serenity needs to instrument the step libraries so that the methods we call (like `startsWith`, `add`, and `shouldHave`) appear in our reports. But more on that later.

Open up the MathWizSteps.class. You should see something like this:

[source,java]
----
public class MathWizSteps {

    String actor;                               <1>

    @Step("#actor starts with {0}")             <2>
    public void startsWith(int amount) {
        // TODO
    }

    @Step("#actor adds {0}")
    public void adds(int amount) {
        // TODO
    }

    @Step("#actor should have {0}")
    public void shouldHave(int expectedTotal) {
        // TODO
    }
}
----
<1> The name of this step actor
<2> How this step will appear in the reports

As you can see, it is a rather ordinary looking class, but with a couple of additions.

Firstly, there is the `actor` field. The `actor` field is an optional field that you can add to your step libraries. If you do, Serenity will pass in the name of the variable (so `michael` in this case) into the step library.

Secondly, each method has a `@Step` annotation. These tell Serenity to add a corresponding entry in the test report whenever this method is called.

The text in the annotation (such as "\#actor starts with {0}") tells Serenity how to render the step. Any fields with the "#" prefix will be rendered (so `#actor` will be replaced by the value of the `actor` field). Any parameters can be reported using positional variables (`{0}` for the first parameter, {1} for the second, and so forth).

If you use the `@Step` annotation alone, Serenity will use the name of the method, in a more human-readable form, in the reports. For example, suppose you have the following step declaration:

```
@Step
public void adds(int amount) {...}
```

This will be rendered as "adds: 2"

=== Make the test fail

For the moment, these step methods are empty. Let's fix that.

We'll start with the first step, `startsWith()`. Let's imagine the calculator API we would like to have. Update the start of the `MathWizSteps` class so it looks like this:

[source,java]
----
public class MathWizSteps {

    String actor;

    Calculator calculator;                      <1>

    @Step("#actor starts with {0}")
    public void startsWith(int amount) {
        calculator = new Calculator(amount);    <2>
    }
----
<1> Add a new Calculator field
<2> Create a new calculator with a given amount

The `Calculator` class doesn't exist (we are designing it here), so create a `Calculator` class in the `src/main/java/starter` directory:

[source,java]
----
public class Calculator {
    private int total;

    public Calculator(int amount) {
        this.total = amount;
    }
}
----

Next, we can flesh out the `adds()` method in the `MathWizSteps` class:

[source,java]
----
@Step("#actor adds {0}")
public void adds(int amount) {
    calculator.add(amount);
}
----

Add the `add()` method to the `Calculator` class, but don't implement it yet (we need to see the test fail before we can trust it when it passes):

[source,java]
----
public class Calculator {
    private int total;

    public Calculator(int amount) {
        this.total = amount;
    }

    public void add(int amount) {

    }
}
----

Next we need to implement the `shouldHave()` method. We will use AssertJ to make a simple assertion. The full class will now look like this:

[source,java]
----
import net.thucydides.core.annotations.Step;
import static org.assertj.core.api.Assertions.assertThat;

public class MathWizSteps {

    String actor;

    Calculator calculator;

    @Step("#actor starts with {0}")
    public void startsWith(int amount) {
        calculator = new Calculator(amount);
    }

    @Step("#actor adds {0}")
    public void adds(int amount) {
        calculator.add(amount);
    }

    @Step("#actor should have {0}")
    public void shouldHave(int expectedTotal) {
        assertThat(calculator.getTotal()).isEqualTo(expectedTotal);
    }
}
----

But we still need to implement the `getTotal()` method in our `Calculator` class. Add a method that returns 0 for now:

[source,java]
----
public int getTotal() {
    return 0;
}
----

Now, remove the `@Pending` annotation from the class. This will tell Serenity to execute the test, and not skip it.Run the test again, using `mvn clean verify` or 'gradle clean test'. You should see a failing test like this:

This is good, because it means our test works. Now let's make the test pass.

=== Make the test pass

Complete the `Calculator` class like this:

[source,java]
----
public class Calculator {
    private int total;

    public Calculator(int amount) {
        this.total = amount;
    }

    public void add(int amount) {
        total = total + amount;
    }

    public int getTotal() {
        return total;
    }
}
----

Now run the test again. With any luck, you should see the following:

----

== Personalise the starter project

Now that you have seen how a simple Serenity test works, we can get onto some serious work. First of all, make yourself at home. To personalise this project, just rename the `starter` package into one that represents the root package for your own project, and delete the sample test and step library.

In the next chapter, you will see how to write your first web test with Serenity.
